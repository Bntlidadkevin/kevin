    <p id="paragraph2">I'm <span id="span">KEVIN BONTALIDAD,</span> BS-Information and Communication Technology</p>
    <p id="paragraph3">I'm 19 years old, and I study at West Visayas State University of Lambunao; my course is BSICT. Lives in Poblacion Ilawod, but my permanent address is in Negros occidental Bacolod city. I'm here because I didn't pass the exam in other colleges in Negros but took an exam in here at WVSULC, and I passed the exam in West Visayas State University of Lambunao. That's why I'm here, and that's why I studied here. And with me here are my sister, her husband, and her child. And my brother is in Negros. He also works and supports me in my studies. My father is with him. My mother is no longer there. She died when I was in grade four because of his kidney disease.</p>
